# Terraform Projects
This repository is a collection of Terraform automation projects applicable to Check Point CloudGuard Native Solution, which are intended to be used as a template in a demonstration or to build a test environment.  In the directories, you will find a description of what each project does and if you want (or need) to customize them, you can change defaults in the different __*name-variables.tf*__ files. 

## Which are the projects available?
The projects can be briefly described as follows:
1. **./multiple-onboarding**: It onboards multiple Public Cloud accounts (Azure/AWS/GCP) and K8s Clusters in one-shot
2. **./k8s-workload**: It creates a K8s Cluster on GCP (GKE), create and application and the onboards the cluster in CloudGuard

## How do you use these projects?
The first thing that you need to do is download this repository, either via "*git clone*" or "*download as ZIP*".  
Choose which are projects that you want to use, and in each directory change the relative __*terraform.tfvars*__ file.   
Once you have done the above, simply go inside the directory of a single project and run these terraform commands.

##
To prepare the current working directory (and install the required providers) run :
```hcl
terraform init 
```
##
To create an execution plan (and see the changes that will be made in your environment) run :
```hcl
terraform plan
``` 
##
To apply the changes required to reach the desired state (and create your environment) run :
```hcl
terraform apply
```
## 
To destroy the Terraform-managed infrastructure, run:
```hcl
terraform destroy
```

If you want (or need) to further customize other project details, you can change defaults in the different __*name-variables.tf*__ files.   
Here you will also able to find the descriptions that explains what each variable is used for.
